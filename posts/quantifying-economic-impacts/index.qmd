- Regional transportation planning expertise
- Growing region with complex investment decisions

**The Next Step I'd Love to Support:** Moving from "How does the system perform?" to "What does this investment do for our region's economy?"

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="50%"}
**Traditional Analysis:**

- Travel time savings
- VMT reduction
- Crash reduction
- Emissions benefits
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
**Enhanced Analysis:**

- Regional job creation
- Economic multiplier effects
- Business attraction potential
- Return on investment metrics
:::

::::

::: info-box
This enhanced perspective helps justify investments to stakeholders and supports competitive grant applications.
:::

::: {.notes}
- Set up the problem: MPOs need to justify investments beyond just traffic metrics
- WFRC faces unique challenges with rapid growth and upcoming Olympics
- Economic analysis helps prioritize limited resources

**Key insight from my experience**: Not all transportation benefits create wider economic impacts. Understanding this distinction helps prioritize projects that maximize both mobility and economic returns.
:::

::: {.notes}
- This is where my technical skills differentiate me from other candidates
- Systematic approach that emphasizes the practical insight about different types of benefits

:::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="50%"}
**Investment Prioritization:**

- Compare economic returns across RTP projects
- Identify investments with highest job creation potential
- Quantify equity impacts across communities

**Major Project Support:**

- FrontRunner electrification business case
- Transit routes expansion
- Point of the Mountain development
- 2034 Olympic transportation investments

:::

::: {.column width="50%"}

::: {.fragment}
**My perspective:** Economic impact analysis works best when it complements and enhances existing technical capabilities rather than replacing them.
:::

::: {.notes}
- Connect directly to WFRC's current priorities and challenges
- Show how this isn't just academic - it's immediately useful
- Emphasize the R integration since that matches WFRC's technical environment
- Shows understanding of WFRC's major initiatives

## What I'm Excited to Explore with WFRC {.center}

#### Questions I'd love to explore with the WFRC team:

::: {.incremental}
- How to communicate the economic value of transportation investments to stakeholders?
- What role might economic analysis play in the activity-based modeling transition?
- How to best support economic justification for major transportation investments in the future?
- What are the priorities for federal grant applications where economic impact matters?

## Technical Deep-Dive {.smaller} {visibility="hidden"}

### R-Based Economic Impact Pipeline

```{r}
#| echo: true
#| eval: false

# Example workflow integrating with WFRC's existing processes
library(tidyverse); library(sf); library(targets)

# 1. Process travel demand model outputs
wfrc_benefits <- process_travel_model_results(
  cube_outputs = "model_scenarios/",
  performance_measures = c("time_savings", "vmt_reduction", "crashes")
)

# 2. Apply economic impact methodology
regional_impacts <- calculate_economic_impacts(
  benefits = wfrc_benefits,
  construction_costs = project_investments,
  study_area = wasatch_front_counties,
  multipliers = utah_implan_data
)

# 3. Generate stakeholder communications
impact_dashboard <- create_interactive_results(regional_impacts)
grant_narrative <- generate_economic_justification(regional_impacts)
```
:::info-box
**Benefits:** Reproducible, well-documented analysis that can be adapted for different projects and scenarios.
:::

::: {.notes}
- Have this ready if they want to dig into technical implementation
- Shows actual R code skills and modern workflow practices
- Demonstrates understanding of reproducible research principles
