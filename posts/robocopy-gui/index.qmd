## Robocopy Command Generator

I've developed an interactive web-based tool that simplifies creating robocopy commands through a user-friendly graphical interface. Instead of memorizing complex command-line syntax, users can simply select options and generate commands visually.

<div style="text-align: center; margin-top: 10px;">
  <a href="https://ar-puuk.github.io/robocopy-gui/" target="_blank" class="btn btn-primary">Open in New Tab</a>
  <a href="https://github.com/ar-puuk/robocopy-gui" target="_blank" class="btn btn-outline-secondary">View Source Code</a>
</div>

## Features

The tool provides an intuitive interface for:

- **Source and Destination Selection**: Easy path input with validation
- **Copy Options**: Checkboxes for common robocopy parameters like `/E`, `/MIR`, `/R:n`, etc.
- **Real-time Preview**: See your robocopy command as you build it
- **Copy to Clipboard**: One-click copying of the generated command
- **Parameter Explanations**: Tooltips and descriptions for each option

## Technical Details

This tool is built with vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, making it lightweight and fast. It's hosted on GitHub Pages, which means it automatically updates whenever I push changes to the [source repository](https://github.com/ar-puuk/robocopy-gui).

The interface translates user selections into proper robocopy syntax, helping both beginners learn the command structure and experienced users save time on complex operations.

## Use Cases

This tool is particularly useful for:

- System administrators managing file synchronization
- IT professionals setting up backup routines  
- Anyone needing to copy large directory structures with specific parameters
- Learning robocopy syntax through visual exploration
