I am an aspiring Associate Transportation Planner with a Masterâ€™s in City & Metropolitan Planning and a background in architecture, specializing in data-driven, multimodal strategies that advance equity, sustainability, and community well-being. I have over three years of hands-on experience in multimodal system evaluation, GIS modeling, benefit-cost and economic impact analysis for state and regional projects. I am skilled in leading interagency programs, managing complex contracts, and engaging diverse stakeholders to deliver innovative, resilient, and accessible transportation solutions grounded in inclusive, community-driven planning.
