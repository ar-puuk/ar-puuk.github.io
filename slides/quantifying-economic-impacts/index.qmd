::: notes
Good morning! I'm Pukar Bhandari, and I'm excited to discuss how economic impact analysis can enhance WFRC's already strong transportation planning capabilities.

I completed my graduate education here at the University of Utah in Transportation Planning, and over the past three years, I've specialized in developing methods that bridge transportation modeling with economic quantification. Most relevant to this role, I've had direct experience working on Utah's transportation planning context - I led economic assessments for Utah's Unified Transportation Plan 2023-2050.

What really excites me about WFRC is the opportunity to support investment prioritization in one of the nation's fastest-growing regions, contribute to 2034 Olympic legacy planning, and be part of your transition to activity-based modeling. My technical background in travel demand modeling with Cube and TransCAD, combined with economic impact tools like IMPLAN, positions me to contribute from day one.

## An Opportunity: From Performance to Impact {.smaller}

**WFRC's Strong Foundation:** - Sophisticated travel demand modeling
capabilities - Activity-based modeling transition underway - Regional
transportation planning expertise - Growing region with complex investment decisions

**The Next Step I'd Love to Support:** Moving from "How does the system perform?" to "What economic value do Utahns get back from their transportation investments?"

:::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="50%"}
**Traditional Analysis:**

-   Travel time savings
-   VMT reduction
-   Crash reduction
-   Emissions benefits

::: {.column width="50%"}
**Enhanced Analysis:**

-   Regional job creation
-   Economic multiplier effects
-   Business attraction potential
-   Return on investment metrics

::: notes
WFRC has built a sophisticated foundation - you have strong travel demand modeling capabilities, you're transitioning to activity-based modeling, and you're dealing with complex investment decisions in a rapidly growing region.

Where I see an opportunity to add value is moving from asking "How does the system perform?" to "What does this investment do for our region's economy?"

Traditional analysis focuses on travel time savings, VMT reduction, crash reduction, and emissions benefits. Enhanced analysis that I can bring adds regional job creation, economic multiplier effects, business attraction potential, and return on investment metrics.

This enhanced perspective doesn't replace what you're already doing well - it helps justify investments to stakeholders and supports competitive grant applications, which is increasingly important in today's funding environment.

**Key insight from my experience**: Not all transportation benefits create wider economic impacts. Understanding this distinction helps prioritize projects that maximize both mobility and economic returns.
:::
:::

::: notes
Here's the systematic framework I've developed through my work. Transportation investments create economic impacts through four main pathways:

First, direct construction stimulus - the immediate jobs and spending from building infrastructure. Second, user cost savings - when people save time, reduce crashes, and spend less on fuel, that money gets reinvested in the economy. Third, market access improvements - better transportation expands labor pools and supplier networks for businesses. And fourth, business attraction - enhanced infrastructure makes locations more competitive for new investment.

All of these feed into broader regional economic impacts: jobs created, household income growth, business output increases, and GDP growth.

The key insight from my experience is that not all transportation benefits create wider economic impacts. Understanding this distinction helps prioritize projects that maximize both mobility and economic returns.

::: notes
Let me show you how this works in practice with Utah's \$88+ billion transportation plan.

My methodology integrated travel demand model outputs with benefit-cost analysis frameworks and economic impact analysis. I built custom R and Excel-based workflows that link transportation performance metrics directly to benefit-cost frameworks, integrate IMPLAN economic multipliers, and produce economic metrics, allowing for scenario-based analysis across multimodal investment alternatives.

The results were significant: construction phase impacts of over 70,000 direct jobs, operations phase benefits with \$230 billion present value over 28 years, total economic impact of \$490 billion in cumulative regional output increase, and a return ratio of $5.6 in economic activity per dollar invested.

This workflow produces clear, reproducible, data-driven impact reports that can directly support WFRC’s future RTP development, Olympic planning, and federal grant applications.

## Potential Applications for WFRC {.smaller}

**Areas where economic impact analysis could enhance WFRC's work:**

:::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="50%"}
**Investment Prioritization:**

-   Compare economic returns across RTP scenarios
-   Identify investments with highest job creation potential
-   Quantify equity impacts across communities

**Major Project Support:**

-   FrontRunner electrification business case
-   Transit routes expansion
-   Point of the Mountain development
-   2034 Olympic transportation investments
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
**Stakeholder Communication:**

-   Translate analysis into economic narratives
-   Support federal grant applications with economic justification
-   Demonstrate transportation's role in regional competitiveness

**Technical Integration:**

-   R-based workflows compatible with WFRC's analytical environment
-   Automated reporting for consistent analysis
-   Integration with activity-based model transition

**My perspective:** Economic impact analysis works best when it complements and enhances existing technical capabilities rather than replacing them.
:::
:::

::: notes
Looking ahead, I see several areas where economic impact analysis could enhance WFRC's work.

For investment prioritization, we could compare economic returns across RTP projects, identify investments with the highest job creation potential, and quantify equity impacts across communities.

For major project support, this approach could strengthen business cases for FrontRunner electrification, transit route expansions, Point of the Mountain development, and 2034 Olympic transportation investments.

For stakeholder communication, we can translate technical analysis into economic narratives, support federal grant applications with economic justification, and demonstrate transportation's role in regional competitiveness.

Technically, R-based workflows would integrate well with WFRC's analytical environment and support your activity-based modeling transition.

My perspective is that economic impact analysis works best when it complements and enhances existing technical capabilities rather than replacing them.

## What I'm Excited to Explore with WFRC {.center}

#### Questions I'd love to explore with the WFRC team:

::: incremental
-   How to communicate the economic value of transportation investments to stakeholders?
-   What role might economic analysis play in the activity-based modeling transition?
-   How to best support economic justification for major transportation investments in the future?
-   What are the priorities for federal grant applications where economic impact matters?
