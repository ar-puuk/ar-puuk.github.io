# Contact

I'm always excited to connect with fellow transportation professionals, urban planners, data scientists, and anyone passionate about improving mobility through data-driven insights. Whether you want to discuss the latest developments in transportation modeling, share experiences with R and geospatial analysis, or debate the merits of different traffic flow algorithms, I'm here for it.

If you have questions about transportation planning methodologies, want to discuss R techniques for mobility data analysis, share interesting datasets, or just want to chat about anything related to transportation and data science, please use this contact form.
