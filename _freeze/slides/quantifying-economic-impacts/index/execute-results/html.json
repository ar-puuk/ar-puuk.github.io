I'm Pukar Bhandari, and I'm excited to discuss how economic impact analysis can enhance WFRC's already strong transportation planning capabilities.\n\nI completed my graduate education here at the University of Utah in Transportation Planning, and over the past three years, I've specialized in developing methods that bridge transportation modeling with economic quantification. Most relevant to this role, I've had direct experience working on Utah's transportation planning context - I led economic assessments for Utah's Unified Transportation Plan 2023-2050.\n\nWhat really excites me about WFRC is the opportunity to support investment prioritization in one of the nation's fastest-growing regions, contribute to 2034 Olympic legacy planning, and be part of your transition to activity-based modeling. My technical background in travel demand modeling with Cube and TransCAD, combined with economic impact tools like IMPLAN, positions me to contribute from day one.\n:::\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n## An Opportunity: From Performance to Impact {.smaller}\n\n**WFRC's Strong Foundation:** - Sophisticated travel demand modeling\ncapabilities - Activity-based modeling transition underway - Regional\ntransportation planning expertise - Growing region with complex investment decisions\n\n**The Next Step I'd Love to Support:** Moving from \"How does the system perform?\" to \"What economic value do Utahns get back from their transportation investments?\"\n\n:::: {.columns}\n::: {.column width=\"50%\"}\n**Traditional Analysis:**\n\n-   Travel time savings\n-   VMT reduction\n-   Crash reduction\n-   Emissions benefits\n:::\n\n::: {.column width=\"50%\"}\n**Enhanced Analysis:**\n\n-   Regional job creation\n-   Economic multiplier effects\n-   Business attraction potential\n-   Return on investment metrics\n:::\n::::\n\n::: info-box\nThis enhanced perspective helps justify investments to stakeholders and supports competitive grant applications.\n:::\n\n::: notes\nWFRC has built a sophisticated foundation - you have strong travel demand modeling capabilities, you're transitioning to activity-based modeling, and you're dealing with complex investment decisions in a rapidly growing region.\n\nWhere I see an opportunity to add value is moving from asking \"How does the system perform?\" to \"What does this investment do for our region's economy?\"\n\nTraditional analysis focuses on travel time savings, VMT reduction, crash reduction, and emissions benefits. Enhanced analysis that I can bring adds regional job creation, economic multiplier effects, business attraction potential, and return on investment metrics.\n\nThis enhanced perspective doesn't replace what you're already doing well - it helps justify investments to stakeholders and supports competitive grant applications, which is increasingly important in today's funding environment.\n:::\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n## Economic Impact Framework I've Applied {.smaller}\n\n::: center\n```{mermaid}\n%%| eval: true\n%%| fig-width: 40\n%%| fig-height: 10\n%%| fig-dpi: 300\n\nflowchart TB\n    A[\"<b>Transportation Investment</b>\"] --> B(\"Direct Construction<br>Stimulus\") & C(\"User Cost Savings<br>Time • Crashes • Fuel\") & D(\"Market Access Improvements<br>Larger Labor/Supplier Pool\") & E(\"Business Attraction<br>Enhanced Site Competitiveness\")\n    B --> F([\"<b>Regional Economic Impacts</b>\"])\n    C --> F\n    D --> F\n    E --> F\n    F --> G[\"Jobs Created\"] & H[\"Household Income\"] & I[\"Business Output\"] & J[\"GDP Growth\"]\n\n    style A fill:#1f5582,color:#ffffff\n    style F fill:#e8f5e8\n    style B fill:#fff3e0\n    style C fill:#e1f5fe\n    style D fill:#f3e5f5\n    style E fill:#fce4ec\n```\n:::\n\n::: info-box\n**Key insight from my experience**: Not all transportation benefits create wider economic impacts. Understanding this distinction helps prioritize projects that maximize both mobility and economic returns.\n:::\n\n::: notes\nHere's the systematic framework I've developed through my work. Transportation investments create economic impacts through four main pathways:\n\nFirst, direct construction stimulus - the immediate jobs and spending from building infrastructure. Second, user cost savings - when people save time, reduce crashes, and spend less on fuel, that money gets reinvested in the economy. Third, market access improvements - better transportation expands labor pools and supplier networks for businesses. And fourth, business attraction - enhanced infrastructure makes locations more competitive for new investment.\n\nAll of these feed into broader regional economic impacts: jobs created, household income growth, business output increases, and GDP growth.\n\nThe key insight from my experience is that not all transportation benefits create wider economic impacts. Understanding this distinction helps prioritize projects that maximize both mobility and economic returns.\n:::\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n## Utah's Unified Plan 2023-2050 {.smaller}\n\n:::: {.columns}\n::: {.column width=\"50%\"}\n**What I contributed to Utah's \\$88 billion transportation plan:**\n\n<br>\n\n<!-- **Methodology:** -->\n\n<!-- - Integrated travel demand model outputs with benefit-cost and economic impact analyses frameworks -->\n\n<!-- - Custom R and MS Excel based workflows linking transportation performance to economic metrics -->\n\n<!-- - Scenario-based analysis across multi-modal investment alternatives -->\n\n::: info-box\n**Key Results:**\n\n-   Construction phase: 70,000+ direct jobs\n-   Societal Benefits: \\$230+ B present value (28 years)\n-   Economic Impact: \\$490 B regional output increase (28 years)\n-   Return Ratio: \\$5.57 economic activity per dollar invested annually\n:::\n\n<br>\n\n**Relevance to WFRC:** This same methodology can support WFRC's RTP development, enhance travel demand modeling, and federal grant applications.\n\n:::\n\n::: {.column width=\"50%\"}\n<!-- **Technical Integration** -->\n\n```{mermaid}\n%%| eval: false\nflowchart TD\n    A[\"🚗 Travel Demand Model Outputs\"] --> B(\"📊 R-based Data Cleaning\")\n    B --> C(\"💰 Benefit Cost Analysis Framework in MS Excel\")\n    C --> D(\"🏭 IMPLAN Economic Multipliers\")\n    D --> E(\"📈 Regional Impact Assessment\")\n    E --> F(\"👥 Stakeholder Communication Tools\")\n\n    A -.-> A1[(\"Travel times, VMT,<br/>volumes, crashes\")]\n    B -.-> B1[(\"tidyverse, sf,<br/>data validation\")]\n    C -.-> C1[(\"NPV calculations,<br/>discount rates\")]\n    D -.-> D1[(\"Industry multipliers,<br/>job coefficients\")]\n    E -.-> E1[(\"Jobs, income,<br/>output impacts\")]\n    F -.-> F1[(\"Dashboards, reports,<br/>visualizations\")]\n\n    style A fill:#1f5582,color:#ffffff\n    style B fill:#e8f5e8\n    style C fill:#fff3e0\n    style D fill:#e1f5fe\n    style E fill:#f3e5f5\n    style F fill:#fce4ec\n\n    style A1 fill:#f9f9f9,stroke:#999,stroke-dasharray: 3 3\n    style B1 fill:#f9f9f9,stroke:#999,stroke-dasharray: 3 3\n    style C1 fill:#f9f9f9,stroke:#999,stroke-dasharray: 3 3\n    style D1 fill:#f9f9f9,stroke:#999,stroke-dasharray: 3 3\n    style E1 fill:#f9f9f9,stroke:#999,stroke-dasharray: 3 3\n    style F1 fill:#f9f9f9,stroke:#999,stroke-dasharray: 3 3\n\nclassDef default font-size:14px;\n```\n\n![](_charts/Presentation%20_%20Mermaid%20Chart-2025-08-03-004921.svg){style=\"height: 70vh;\"}\n\n<!-- *Reproducible, automated pipeline* -->\n:::\n::::\n\n::: notes\nLet me show you how this works in practice with Utah's \\$88+ billion transportation plan.\n\nMy methodology integrated travel demand model outputs with benefit-cost analysis frameworks and economic impact analysis. I built custom R and Excel-based workflows that link transportation performance directly to economic metrics, allowing for scenario-based analysis across multimodal investment alternatives.\n\nThe results were significant: construction phase impacts of over 70,000 direct jobs, operations phase benefits with \\$230 billion present value over 28 years, total economic impact of \\$490 billion in cumulative regional output increase, and a return ratio of $5.6 in economic activity per dollar invested.\n\nThe technical integration follows this pipeline - we start with travel model outputs, process them through R-based analysis, apply benefit-cost frameworks, integrate IMPLAN economic multipliers, and produce impact reports.\n\nThis same methodology can directly support WFRC's RTP development, Olympic planning, and federal grant applications.\n:::\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n## Potential Applications for WFRC {.smaller}\n\n**Areas where economic impact analysis could enhance WFRC's work:**\n\n:::: {.columns}\n::: {.column width=\"50%\"}\n**Investment Prioritization:**\n\n-   Compare economic returns across RTP scenarios\n-   Identify investments with highest job creation potential\n-   Quantify equity impacts across communities\n\n**Major Project Support:**\n\n-   FrontRunner electrification business case\n-   Transit routes expansion\n-   Point of the Mountain development\n-   2034 Olympic transportation investments\n:::\n\n::: {.column width=\"50%\"}\n**Stakeholder Communication:**\n\n-   Translate analysis into economic narratives\n-   Support federal grant applications with economic justification\n-   Demonstrate transportation's role in regional competitiveness\n\n**Technical Integration:**\n\n-   R-based workflows compatible with WFRC's analytical environment\n-   Automated reporting for consistent analysis\n-   Integration with activity-based model transition\n:::\n::::\n\n::: fragment\n::: info-box\n**My perspective:** Economic impact analysis works best when it complements and enhances existing technical capabilities rather than replacing them.\n:::\n:::\n\n::: notes\nLooking ahead, I see several areas where economic impact analysis could enhance WFRC's work.\n\nFor investment prioritization, we could compare economic returns across RTP projects, identify investments with the highest job creation potential, and quantify equity impacts across communities.\n\nFor major project support, this approach could strengthen business cases for FrontRunner electrification, transit route expansions, Point of the Mountain development, and 2034 Olympic transportation investments.\n\nFor stakeholder communication, we can translate technical analysis into economic narratives, support federal grant applications with economic justification, and demonstrate transportation's role in regional competitiveness.\n\nTechnically, R-based workflows would integrate well with WFRC's analytical environment and support your activity-based modeling transition.\n\nMy perspective is that economic impact analysis works best when it complements and enhances existing technical capabilities rather than replacing them.\n:::\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n## What I'm Excited to Explore with WFRC {.center}\n\n#### Questions I'd love to explore with the WFRC team:\n\n::: incremental\n-   How to communicate the economic value of transportation investments to stakeholders?\n-   What role might economic analysis play in the activity-based modeling transition?\n-   How to best support economic justification for major transportation investments in the future?\n-   What are the priorities for federal grant applications where economic impact matters?\n:::\n\n::: notes\nI'm excited to explore several questions with the WFRC team: How can we best communicate the economic value of transportation investments to stakeholders? What role might economic analysis play in your activity-based modeling transition? How can we support economic justification for 2034 Olympic-related investments?
